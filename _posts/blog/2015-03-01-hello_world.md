Hi. How are you? I don't really know how to start these things. 

While fiddling around with building my website, the thought of starting a blog came to my mind.

I’ll even make this blog into some sort diary; jotting down my experiences as I journey through this thing called life. Sounds like a plan. 

Well, I better introduce myself. My name is Jeremy (Mingxuan) Li.

Let’s make this blog about the evolving perceptions of my life and mentality.

Thanks for reading. Just my random thoughts, that’s all. 

Jeremy
